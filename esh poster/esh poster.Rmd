\begin{center}
Simulating data is a bitch. 
\end{center}
***

Debugging frequently dominates the time of students in mathematical science. 
These students know how to solve equations, and next to nothing about code. 

***

New tools are emerging daily to enable researchers to avoid these timesink pitfalls. 

These tools have lowered the programmatic barrier for researchers, but it still a learning curve. 

***

We consider a case study in meta-analysis.

\begin{description}
\item[meta-analysis] Statistical methodology for combining the results of several studies.

# meta-analysis of medians

Conventional meta-analytic tools, such as `metafor::rma`, require an **effect** and a **variance** of that effect.

***

But what if the reported statistics are **median** and **interquartile** range?

***

To test our proposed estimator for the variance of the sample median, I found myself repeating tasks and checks in the algorithms. 

***

I tried to find a better way of debugging and writing simulations.

This lead to: 

1. a packaged analysis, `varameta::`*, which is built on 
2. the simulation package for meta-analysis data, `metasim::`*. 

(*in development)

Generate sample sizes for $k$ studies.

```

```{r}
# generate simulation dataframe
sim_df() %>% head(2) %>% select(-n) %>% output_table()
```

Each **row** of this dataframe represents a set of **simulation** parameters.

Each simulation runs a **trial** function.

# Introduction

Welcome to `posterdown` ! This is my attempt to provide a semi-smooth workflow for those who wish to take their `RMarkdown` skills to the conference world. Many creature comforts from `RMarkdown` are available in this package such as `Markdown` section notation, figure captioning, and even citations like this one [@holden_identifying_2012] The rest of this example poster will show how you can insert typical conference poster features into your own document. 

# Study Site

Here is a map made to show the study site using `ggplot2`, `ggspatial`, and `sf` and you can even reference this with a hyperlink, this will take you to **Figure \ref{mymapfig}**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [@middleton_geological_nodate] consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

```{r, eval=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap='This is a map of Canada, the ggspatial package is great for GIS folks in R! \\label{mymapfig}', cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(sf)

canada <- read_sf("data/Canada.geojson")

yukon <- canada %>% 
  filter(PROV == "YT")

# Objectives

1. Easy to use reproducible poster design. 
2. Integration with `RMarkdown`.
3. Easy transition from `posterdown` to `thesisdown` or `rticles`

# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the `RMarkdown` you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > Latex > PDF.

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calcualated. In posterdown this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical `RMarkdown` formatting. I suggesting checking out the `kableExtra` package and its in depth documentation on customizing these tables found [here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).

\vspace{1cm}

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

data("iris")

kable(iris[1:4,],align = "c", caption = "Tables are a breeze with Kable and Kable extra package!", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","HOLD_position"),full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25)

```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r eval=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.height=4.5, fig.cap='Using ggplot and patchwork to generate a layout of multiple plots in one figure. The iris dataset was used to generate (a) a line graph, (b) a scatterplot, and (c) a boxplot all together!'}

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_gray() + theme_tufte() + theme(legend.position = "none"))

base <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
  
p_point <- base + geom_point()
p_line  <- base + geom_line() 
p_area  <- base + geom_area()
p_box1  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species))
p_box2  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species))

p_line + 
  {p_point + p_box1} +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a", tag_prefix = "(",tag_suffix = ")")

```


```{r eval=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Another typical plot using ggplot, this time with a different theme and r code chunk options for fig.width and fig.height.'}

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepeal Width") +
  NULL

```


```{r eval=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.width=4.5, fig.align='center', echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Another figure showing how base R plots might look on this poster!'}

# Here is some code for people
# to look at and be in awe of!!!!
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data=iris,
       aes(x = Sepal.Width,
           y = Sepal.Length,
           colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_tufte() +
  NULL

```

# Next Steps

There is still **A LOT** of work to do on this package which include (but are note limited to): 

- Better softcoding for front end user options in YAML
- Images in the title section for logo placement which is a common attribut to posters as far as I have come to know.
- Figure out compatiability with `natbib` which wasn't working during the initial set up.
- MUCH BETTER PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION. For example, there is nothing in the README...
- Include References section only if initiated by the user like in RMarkdown.

<!--- Here you can set the size of the citation text as well as remove the "References" section if you choose not to have one for some reason :) -->
